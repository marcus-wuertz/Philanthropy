# Philanthropy
I was the philanthropy chair for my fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, from Nov 2022 to Nov 2023. During that time, I held a week-long philanthropy and kept detailed data for each day. We had a bake sale, volleyball tournament, and a Pie-A-Pike/Dunk Tank event. After the philanthropy, I used the data to create visualizations in Tableau. We were able to raise over $1,200 for Miracle on the Mountain, a local organization trying to build a playground accessible to children with disabilities.
